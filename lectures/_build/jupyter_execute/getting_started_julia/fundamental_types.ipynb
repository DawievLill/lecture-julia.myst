    "## Array Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "([See multi-dimensional arrays documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/))\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is one of the most important types, we will start with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will see how arrays (and all other types in Julia) are handled in a generic and extensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shape and Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen some Julia arrays in action\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output tells us that the arrays are of types `Array{Int64,1}` and `Array{Float64,1}` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `Int64` and `Float64` are types for the elements inferred by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk more about types later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `1` in `Array{Int64,1}` and `Array{Any,1}` indicates that the array is\n",
    "one dimensional (i.e., a `Vector`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the default for many Julia functions that create arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "typeof(randn(100))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, one dimensional vectors are best interpreted as column vectors, which we will see when we take transposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check the dimensions of `a` using `size()` and `ndims()`\n",
    "functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "ndims(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "size(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax `(3,)` displays a tuple containing one element -- the size along the one dimension that exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Array vs Vector vs Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, `Vector` and `Matrix` are just aliases for one- and two-dimensional arrays\n",
    "respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "Array{Int64, 1} == Vector{Int64}\n",
    "Array{Int64, 2} == Matrix{Int64}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector construction with `,` is then interpreted as a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, we can create a column vector and row vector more directly\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "[1, 2, 3] == [1; 2; 3]  # both column vectors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "[1 2 3]  # a row vector is 2-dimensional\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, in Julia we have both\n",
    "\n",
    "* one-dimensional arrays (i.e., flat arrays)\n",
    "* arrays of size `(1, n)` or `(n, 1)` that represent row and column vectors respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need both?\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, dimension matters for matrix algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiplying by a row vector is different to multiplying by a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other, we use arrays in many settings that don't involve matrix algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, we don't care about the distinction between row and column vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why many Julia functions return flat arrays by default.\n",

    "### Creating Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions that Create Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen some functions for creating a vector filled with `0.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "zeros(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalizes to matrices and higher dimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "zeros(2, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To return an array filled with a single value, use `fill`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "fill(5.0, 2, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can create an empty array using the `Array()` constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = Array{Float64}(undef, 2, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The printed values you see here are just garbage values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(the existing contents of the allocated memory slots being interpreted as 64 bit floats)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more control over the types, fill with a non-floating point\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "fill(0, 2, 2)  # fills with 0, not 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or fill with a boolean type\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "fill(false, 2, 2)  # produces a boolean matrix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Arrays from Existing Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, we will avoid directly specifying the types of arrays, and let the compiler deduce the optimal types on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for this, discussed in more detail in {doc}`this lecture <../more_julia/generic_programming>`, are to ensure both clarity and generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One place this can be inconvenient is when we need to create an array based on an existing array.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that assignment in Julia binds a name to a value, but does not make a copy of that type\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = x\n",
    "y[1] = 2\n",
    "x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, `y = x` simply creates a new named binding called `y` which refers to whatever `x` currently binds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy the data, you need to be more explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = copy(x)\n",
    "y[1] = 2\n",
    "x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, rather than making a copy of `x`, you may want to just have a similarly sized array\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = similar(x)\n",
    "y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use `similar` to pre-allocate a vector with a different size, but the same shape\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = similar(x, 4)  # make a vector of length 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which generalizes to higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = similar(x, 2, 2)  # make a 2x2 matrix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual Array Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, you can create one dimensional arrays from manually specified data like so\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In two dimensions we can proceed as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10 20 30 40]  # two dimensional, shape is 1 x n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "ndims(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10 20; 30 40]  # 2 x 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might then assume that `a = [10; 20; 30; 40]` creates a two dimensional column vector but this isn't the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10; 20; 30; 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "ndims(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead transpose the matrix (or adjoint if complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10 20 30 40]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "ndims(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen the basics of array indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [10 20 30 40]\n",
    "a[end-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a[1:3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2D arrays the index syntax is straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = randn(2, 2)\n",
    "a[1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a[1, :]  # first row\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a[:, 1]  # first column\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans can be used to extract elements\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = randn(2, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "b = [true false; false true]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a[b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for conditional extraction, as we'll see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An aside: some or all elements of an array can be set equal to one number using slice notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = zeros(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a[2:end] .= 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Views and Slices\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `:` notation provides a slice of an array, copying the sub-array to a new array with a similar type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1 2; 3 4]\n",
    "b = a[:, 2]\n",
    "@show b\n",
    "a[:, 2] = [4, 5] # modify a\n",
    "@show a\n",
    "@show b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **view** on the other hand does not copy the value\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1 2; 3 4]\n",
    "@views b = a[:, 2]\n",
    "@show b\n",
    "a[:, 2] = [4, 5]\n",
    "@show a\n",
    "@show b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only difference is the `@views` macro, which will replace any slices with views in the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to call the `view` function directly -- though it is generally discouraged since it is a step away from the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "@views b = a[:, 2]\n",
    "view(a, :, 2) == b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most programming in Julia, it is best to avoid prematurely assuming that `@views` will have a significant impact on performance, and stress code clarity above all else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important lesson about `@views` is that they **are not** normal, dense arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1 2; 3 4]\n",
    "b_slice = a[:, 2]\n",
    "@show typeof(b_slice)\n",
    "@show typeof(a)\n",
    "@views b = a[:, 2]\n",
    "@show typeof(b);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of `b` is a good example of how types are not as they may seem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1 2; 3 4]\n",
    "b = a'   # transpose\n",
    "typeof(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy into a dense array\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "a = [1 2; 3 4]\n",
    "b = a' # transpose\n",
    "c = Matrix(b)  # convert to matrix\n",
    "d = collect(b) # also `collect` works on any iterable\n",
    "c == d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw with `transpose`, sometimes types that look like matrices are not stored as a dense array.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider creating a diagonal matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "d = [1.0, 2.0]\n",
    "a = Diagonal(d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the type is `2×2 Diagonal{Float64,Array{Float64,1}}`, which is not a 2-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for this are both efficiency in storage, as well as efficiency in arithmetic and matrix operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every important sense, matrix types such as `Diagonal` are just as much a \"matrix\" as the dense matrices we have using (see the {doc}`introduction to types lecture <../getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types>` for more)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "@show 2a\n",
    "b = rand(2,2)\n",
    "@show b * a;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is in the construction of an identity matrix, where a naive implementation is\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "b = [1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]\n",
    "b - Diagonal([1.0, 1.0])  # poor style, inefficient code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas you should instead use\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "b = [1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]\n",
    "b - I  # good style, and note the lack of dimensions of I\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While the implementation of `I` is a little abstract to go into at this point, a hint is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "typeof(I)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a `UniformScaling` type rather than an identity matrix, making it much more powerful and general.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment and Passing Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, in Julia, the left hand side of an assignment is a \"binding\" or a label to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1 2 3]\n",
    "y = x  # name `y` binds to whatever value `x` bound to\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequence of this, is that you can re-bind that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1 2 3]\n",
    "y = x        # name `y` binds to whatever `x` bound to\n",
    "z = [2 3 4]\n",
    "y = z        # only changes name binding, not value!\n",
    "@show (x, y, z);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if `a` is an array and we set `b = a` then `a` and `b` point to exactly the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, suppose you had meant to change the value of `x` to the values of `y`, you need to assign the values rather than the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "x = [1 2 3]\n",
    "y = x       # name `y` binds to whatever `x` bound to\n",
    "z = [2 3 4]\n",
    "y .= z      # now dispatches the assignment of each element\n",
    "@show (x, y, z);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you could have used `y[:] = z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to in-place functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define a simple function for a linear map\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "function f(x)\n",
    "    return [1 2; 3 4] * x  # matrix * column vector\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "val = [1, 2]\n",
    "f(val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, these \"out-of-place\" functions are preferred to \"in-place\" functions, which modify the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "function f(x)\n",
    "    return [1 2; 3 4] * x # matrix * column vector\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "val = [1, 2]\n",
    "y = similar(val)\n",
    "\n",
    "function f!(out, x)\n",
    "    out .= [1 2; 3 4] * x\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "f!(y, val)\n",
    "y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates a key convention in Julia: functions which modify any of the arguments have the name ending with `!` (e.g. `push!`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see a common mistake, where instead of modifying the arguments, the name binding is swapped\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "function f(x)\n",
    "    return [1 2; 3 4] * x  # matrix * column vector\n",
    "end\n",

    "val = [1, 2]\n",
    "y = similar(val)\n",
    "\n",
    "function f!(out, x)\n",
    "    out = [1 2; 3 4] * x   # MISTAKE! Should be .= or [:]\n",
    "end\n",
    "f!(y, val)\n",
    "y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of making this mistake is one of the reasons to avoid in-place functions, unless proven to be necessary by benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-place and Immutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that scalars are always immutable, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "y = [1 2]\n",
    "y .-= 2    # y .= y .- 2, no problem\n",
    "\n",
