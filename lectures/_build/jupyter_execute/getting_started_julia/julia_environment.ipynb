    "\n",
    "In this lecture we'll start examining different features of the Julia and Jupyter environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "(ipython_notebook)=\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the easiest way to get started with these notebooks is to follow the {ref}`cloning instructions <clone_lectures>` earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have Jupyter installed and in your path, `cd` to the folder location in a terminal, and run\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} none\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your web browser should open to a page that looks something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/starting_nb_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The page you are looking at is called the \"dashboard\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on \"Julia 1.x.x\" you should have the option to start a Julia notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what your Julia notebook should look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb2_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook displays an *active cell*, into which you can type Julia commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the previous figure the cell is surrounded by a blue border.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the cell is selected, and double-clicking will place it in edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, you can type in Julia code and it will appear in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready to execute these commands, hit `Shift-Enter`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb3_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modal Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit mode\n",
    "    * Indicated by a green border around one cell, as in the pictures above.\n",
    "    * Whatever you type appears as is in that cell.\n",
    "1. Command mode\n",
    "    * The green border is replaced by a blue border.\n",
    "    * Key strokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing b adds a new cell below  the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(To learn about other commands available in command mode, go to \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in the \"Help\" menu)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switching modes\n",
    "\n",
    "* To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key.\n",
    "* To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To run an existing Julia file using the notebook you can copy and paste the contents into a cell in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's a long file, however, you have the alternative of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Saving the file in your **present working directory**.\n",
    "1. Executing `include(\"filename\")` in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present working directory can be found by executing the command `pwd()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you're using a JupyterHub setup, you will need to first run\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} _static/includes/deps_generic.jl\n",
    "---\n",
    "tags: [hide-output]\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in a new cell (i.e., `Shift + Enter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This might take 15-20 minutes depending on your setup, as it installs a large set of packages for our use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following cell\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} julia\n",
    "using Plots\n",
    "gr(fmt=:png);\n",
    "plot(sin, -2π, 2π, label=\"sin(x)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see something like this (although the style of plot depends on your\n",
    "installation)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb4_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The \"time-to-first-plot\" in Julia takes a while, since it needs to compile many functions - but is almost instantaneous the second time you run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over some more Jupyter notebook features --- enough so that we can press ahead with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tab Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "Tab completion in Jupyter makes it easy to find Julia commands and functions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you type `rep` and hit the tab key you'll get a list of all\n",
    "commands that start with `rep`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb5_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(gs_help)=\n",
    "#### Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "To get help on the Julia function such as `repeat`, enter `? repeat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation should now appear in the browser\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/repeatexample.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Content\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to executing code, the Jupyter notebook allows you to embed text, equations, figures and even videos in the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we enter a mixture of plain text and LaTeX instead of code\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb6_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we `Esc` to enter command mode and then type `m` to indicate that we\n",
    "are writing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a mark-up language similar to (but simpler than) LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can also use your mouse to select `Markdown` from the `Code` drop-down box just below the list of menu items)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we `Shift + Enter` to produce this\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/nb7_julia.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting unicode (e.g. Greek letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia supports the use of [unicode characters](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/)\n",
    "such as `α` and `β` in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode characters can be typed quickly in Jupyter using the `tab` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try creating a new code cell and typing `\\alpha`, then hitting the `tab` key on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute shell commands (system commands) in Jupyter by prepending a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `; ls` will execute the UNIX style shell command `ls`,\n",
    "which --- at least for UNIX style operating systems --- lists the\n",
    "contents of the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "These shell commands are handled by your default system shell and hence are platform specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute package operations in the notebook by prepending a `]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `] st` will give the status of installed packages in the current environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Cells where you use `;` and `]` must not have any other instructions in them (i.e., they should be one-liners).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharing Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook files are just text files structured in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and typically end with `.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook can easily be saved and shared between users --- you just need to\n",
    "pass around the `ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open an existing `ipynb` file, import it from the dashboard (the first\n",
    "browser page that opens when you start Jupyter notebook) and run the cells or edit as discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter organization has a site for sharing notebooks called [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)\n",
    "which provides a static HTML representations of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "QuantEcon also hosts the [QuantEcon Notes](http://notes.quantecon.org/) website, where you can upload and share your notebooks with other economists and the QuantEcon community.\n",
    "\n",
    "(julia_repl)=\n",
    "## Using the REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the {ref}`desktop installation <intro_repl>`, the REPL is a Julia specific terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes increasingly important as you learn Julia, and you will find it to be a useful tool for interacting with Julia and installing packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, to open the REPL on your desktop, either\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigating to Julia through your menus or desktop icons (Windows, Mac), or\n",
    "1. Opening a terminal and typing `julia` (Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a JupyterHub installation, you can start the REPL in JupyterLab by choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose \"New Launcher\"\n",
    "1. Choose a `Julia` Console\n",
    "\n",
    "We examine the REPL and its different modes in more detail in the {ref}`tools and editors <repl_main>` lecture."
